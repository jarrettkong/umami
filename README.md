# MovieTrackr App

This project is a Turing front-end evelopment project focused on working with React, Redux, and and Enzyme/Jest.

This app is designed for users in the Denver Area who want to discover the local Japanese food. Users can search for a restaurant they want, or browse the new and trending restaurants on the home page. On an individual restaurant's page, users can see an embedded Google Maps view, with a pin for the location of the restaurant, as well as recent reviews. If they would like to see more information, there is a link to the full Yelp site.

## UI Design

There was no given direction for the design of the site, but the home and search pages were inspired by [OpenTable](https://www.opentable.com/). The individual restaurant pages had no layout reference, but elements like the map implementation, recent reviews, and unique photo are elements taken from both Open Table and [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/)
